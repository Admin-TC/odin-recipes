    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sweet, slow-cooked melty carrots and beautifully tender meat, this dish is comfort in a pot.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1kg stewing beef, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>10 carrots, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>500ml can Guinness</li>
        <li>1 beef stock cube</li>
        <li>pinch of sugar</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>big thyme sprig</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Heat the oil in large lidded casserole dish, brown the meat really well in batches, then set aside. Add the onion and carrots to the dish, give them a good browning, then scatter over the flour and stir. Tip the meat and any juices back into the dish and give it all a good stir. Pour over the Guinness and crumble in the stock cube. Season the stew with salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar. Tuck in the herbs and bring everything to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Cover with a lid and place in the oven for about 2½ hrs until the meat is really tender. The stew can now be chilled and frozen for up to 3 months – defrost completely before reheating until piping hot. Leave the stew to settle a little, then serve with Creamy parsnip mash for a true celebration of winter vegetables.</li>
    </ol>
